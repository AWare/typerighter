Initial user stories for the rule management service, in order of priority as determined by stakeholder voting.

These are the result of ideation sessions ‚Äì not all will be implemented, but they give a good snapshot of our aspirations for the service at its inception.

## As a rule owner, I can
- Browse all rules, sorting and filtering by useful fields (useful tbc, but will include e.g. date created, description, name, id)
- Easily see when, why and by whom a rule was created/modified because that will save a lot of tedious conversations that have been had before.
- Review all the requests for changes from users that have been made
- Test my rule quickly iteratively with ability to test it in isolation or in context of all other or just overlapping rules.
- Include test cases as part of a rule set that the rule must match / not match which can be used to ensure rules are not broken later
- Target my rules to specific content (via desk or tags or region) so that I can cater to "niche" populations.
- See/check whether there is an existing rule before submitting. (eg stack overflow: has this question already been answered?)
- Quickly add to ‚Äúnames/terms dictionary‚Äù even if I never heard of regex (and the proximity spellings are sorted out for me automagically)
- Make changes to or add new rules without impacting the work of another rule owner i.e. if doing something simultaneously
- Disable/delete problematic rules when theyre a bit broken (providing a reason)",
- See what categories of rules there are and create a new one if necessary (typography, world cup 2024, style guide etc) so that anarchy doesnt ensue.",
- See how many times my rules have been accepted/rejected, so I can see the impact of my work.
- Add a new rule or make changes to an existing rule in some cases without needing comprehensive knowledge of regex ü§û
- Check if there are similar rules to the one I want to add already being applied
- See what kind of rules are most and least applied
- Specify what region a rule should apply to (UK v. AUS v. US English is different on spelling for example)
- Publish my rule without affecting others work
- Be notified about a new term/name that appears in Guardian corpus, so that I can have a think if new rule should be created
- Remove or disable many rules at once
- Use regex and other helpers, like links to LT docs, in the rule creation environment to be able to write better rules.
- Pilot a new rule with a beta group before rolling it out to everyone.
- Test NLP/LanguageTool (any?) rules on a massive Guardian corpus because this is the only way to see that they are robust
- Do a regex search on a massive Guardian corpus becuse a) this is the only way to check a rule is robust and b) This tells me if a rule is needed in the first place.
- Add a rule involving NLP without technical knowlege because tht knowedge is hard
- Easily share my thoughts with other rule owners if I need advice.
- Use statistical methods for homophones (donor v doner) as in SG because some problems can only be solved this way.
- View related rules - suggestions of other rules that may need to be revisited?

## As a rule user, I can ...
- Navigate to the Typerighter rule page via a match in a document
- Suggest a new rule or a change to an existing rule easily
- Request a new rule
- Ask for a rule to be amended
- See if/when a rule was changed, and why it changed
- See an explanation / justification of a rule ‚Äì e.g. discussion of why it's needed",
- Comment on a particular rule
- Tell if a rule is "new" ‚Äì e.g. 'recently added' roundel, or, even better, 'since you last used the tool'
- Submit occurrences that challenge the rule (ideally to encourage a review)
- Flag rules that require urgent review (with notes?)
- See recently added/changed rules with edit history
- See what rule subsets are available for use and can switch them on and off easily (eg Olympic games 2020, FTSE 100 companies, US/GB)
- Get a roundup email of recent admissions (weekly?)
- Dismiss advisory rule (until changed) and see which ones I dismissed to review them
- Quickly jump to relevant Style Guide entry (if available) or to online source for terms (people Wikipedia page etc)
- Be notified if a 'recently' published piece has been flagged to contain an occurrence of an important revision."
- Specify a set of rules depending on my region (spelling)

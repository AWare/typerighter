# Vision

The goal of Typerighter is to provide a [universally available](#universal) document checking service, via  an [easy-to-use](#easy-to-use) and [minimal interface](#minimal), that is [accurate](#accurate), [transparent](#transparent), and [responsive to change](#responsive-to-change).

## Universal

Good proofing tools should provide value to users wherever they write.

Typerighter should be available for use across our internal toolset and beyond it. It should be easy for other applications to integrate with it, regardless of platform or publishing cadence. It should just care about text.

### KPIs

- Adoption
- Number of tools using the service

## Easy to use

A frictionless experience keeps users engaged.

Typerighter should be easy to use, for writers and maintainers alike. The less friction our users experience, the better they are able to do their jobs.

### KPIs

- User feedback
- Adoption

## Minimal

Bloated tooling gets in the way.

For the user, Typerighter provides a simple service. We should ensure that the user interface reflects that simplicity.

### KPIs

- User feedback

## Accurate

Accurate tools gain their users' trust.

Typerighter should provide a service that values accuracy over volume. Broadly defined rules add noise to the signal users receive. Poorly defined rules are more likely to result in false positives or negatives. Both outcomes reduce users' trust in the service.

Typerighter should provide tooling that helps us audit our rules against our content, to ensure that we're best placed to understand their impact in daily use.

### KPIs

- High ratio of accepted suggestions where suggestions are provided
- User feedback

## Transparent

Opaque tooling is difficult to reason about.

Typerighter should provide a service that is as transparent as possible, whether the user is checking text or writing rules. When Typerighter matches text, it should be clear why that match has occurred. When Typerighter has suggestions for changes to text, the user should be in charge of every single edit. And when rules are added or changed, it should be clear to users why that modification has taken place.

### KPIs

- Low frequency of feedback related to provenance of rules
- Feedback related to inaccurate rules is clearly actionable

## Responsive to change

Change is a permanent fact of language.

Typerighter's rules should be as  easy as possible to add and alter in a 24/7 news cycle. And when it's clear that a rule is not performing as it should, it should be trivial  for a user to let its maintainers know, with as much context as possible included by default in the feedback. 

### KPIs

- Changes are submitted with high quality feedback
- Usage by editorial as an authoritative source for rule/style guide knowledge

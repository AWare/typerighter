# Typerighter CDK TypeScript project

This directory contains the CDK files used to generate the Typerighter infrastructure. 
Currently, only the Rule-Manager infrastructure is generated in this way.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `yarn synth`       Synthesizes the CloudFormation template
 * `yarn build`       Compiles the Typescript to JS
 * `yarn watch`       Watches for changes and compiles
